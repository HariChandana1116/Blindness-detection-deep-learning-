The training data consists of 38,788 images of eyes from two separate Kaggle competitions.
All images were transformed to 244x244 .jpg files and cropped in such a way so that the image of the eye takes up as much of the image as possible. 
The preprocessing was done and the results were published as a public Kaggle dataset for anyone to use.
